# Notification Permission - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 Problem Solved
You can open images but don't see notifications after downloading? This is because Android 13+ requires explicit permission for notifications.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### Automatic Permission Request
When you log in to the app, you'll now see a dialog asking:

**"السماح بالإشعارات"** (Allow Notifications)

Just tap **"السماح"** (Allow) and then tap **"Allow"** on the system dialog.

## 📱 How to Use

### First Time Login:
1. **Log in to the app**
2. **Dialog appears**: "السماح بالإشعارات"
3. **Tap "السماح"** (Allow button on the right)
4. **System asks**: "Allow [App] to send you notifications?"
5. **Tap "Allow"**
6. **Done!** ✅ Now you'll get notifications

### If You Tap "لاحقاً" (Later):
No problem! When you download a file, you'll see a message with a **"تفعيل"** (Enable) button. Just tap it to enable notifications.

## 🔔 After Enabling Notifications

When you download a file:
1. Download completes ✅
2. **Notification appears** at the top of your screen
3. **Tap the notification** → File opens automatically!
4. Alternative: Tap **"فتح"** (Open) button in the green success message

## 🛠️ If You Accidentally Denied Permission

### Option 1: Enable via Download Message
1. Download any file
2. Green message appears: "تم تحميل الملف بنجاح"
3. Orange message appears: "قم بتفعيل الإشعارات لتلقي تنبيهات التحميل"
4. **Tap "تفعيل"** button
5. Dialog appears → Tap "السماح"

### Option 2: Enable via App Settings
1. Go to your phone's **Settings**
2. Find **Apps** or **Applications**
3. Find your messaging app
4. Tap **Notifications**
5. Turn ON **"All [app name] notifications"**

### Option 3: Reinstall App (if nothing else works)
1. Uninstall the app
2. Reinstall from store
3. Log in
4. This time tap "السماح" when dialog appears

## 📊 What Each Button Does

### In Permission Dialog:
- **"لاحقاً"** (Later) = Skip for now, can enable later
- **"السماح"** (Allow) = Request permission now ✅ Recommended

### In Download Success Message:
- **"فتح"** (Open) = Open downloaded file immediately
- **"تفعيل"** (Enable) = Enable notifications

### In Settings Dialog:
- **"إلغاء"** (Cancel) = Close dialog
- **"فتح الإعدادات"** (Open Settings) = Go to app settings

## ✨ Benefits After Enabling

| Without Permission | With Permission ✅ |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| No notification | **Notification appears** |
| Don't know download finished | **Instant alert** |
| Have to find file manually | **Tap notification → Opens file** |
| Uncertain about download status | **Clear confirmation** |

```

## 🔍 Check If It's Working

### Test:
1. Log in to app
2. Go to any conversation
3. Download a file (tap on image/file)
4. Wait for download to complete
5. **Look at notification bar** at top of screen
6. You should see: "تم تحميل الملف"
7. **Tap it** → File opens!

### If you DON'T see notification:
- Check your phone's notification settings
- Make sure "Do Not Disturb" is OFF
- Verify app notifications are enabled in system settings

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Android 13+**: Permission required (automatic dialog)
- **Android 12 and below**: Works automatically (no dialog needed)
- **iOS**: Permission requested automatically on first launch
- **Permission is optional**: App works fine without it, just no notifications

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### Quick Checks:
1. ✅ Are you on Android 13 or newer?
2. ✅ Did you see the permission dialog?
3. ✅ Did you tap "Allow" on BOTH dialogs?
4. ✅ Is "Do Not Disturb" turned off?
5. ✅ Are app notifications enabled in phone settings?

### Force Reset:
```
Settings → Apps → [Your App] → Storage → Clear Data
```
Then reinstall and try again.
