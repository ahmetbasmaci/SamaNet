# File Sending and Download Implementation - Fix Documentation

## Date: October 4, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Double File Sending Issue** ✅
**Problem**: When selecting a file in the conversation page, it was being sent twice.

**Root Cause**: No guard mechanism to prevent multiple file uploads when the user rapidly tapped the attachment button or when the system triggered duplicate events.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `_isUploadingFile` flag check at the beginning of all file/image/video picker methods
- Added early return if upload is already in progress
- Added guard check in `_uploadAndSendFile` method to prevent concurrent uploads
- Added mounted check before setting state in finally block

**Files Modified**:
- `lib/presentation/pages/messages_page.dart`
  - `_pickFile()` - Added upload guard
  - `_pickImageFromCamera()` - Added upload guard
  - `_pickImageFromGallery()` - Added upload guard
  - `_pickVideoFromCamera()` - Added upload guard
  - `_pickVideoFromGallery()` - Added upload guard
  - `_uploadAndSendFile()` - Added upload guard and mounted check

### 2. **File Download Implementation** ✅
**Problem**: Receiver users couldn't download sent files.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `path_provider` package to pubspec.yaml for managing download directories
- Enhanced `FileService` with proper download functionality using Dio
- Implemented download progress tracking
- Created platform-specific download paths (Android external storage, iOS documents)
- Added unique filename generation to prevent overwrites
- Created "SamaNet" folder in downloads for organized file management

**Files Modified**:
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added `path_provider: ^2.1.1`
- `lib/data/services/file_service.dart`
  - Added Dio import and instance
  - Implemented `downloadFile()` method with progress callback
  - Added `_downloadFileWithDio()` helper method
  - Platform-specific directory handling
- `lib/presentation/widgets/media_viewer.dart`
  - Added `_isDownloading` and `_downloadProgress` state variables
  - Implemented `_downloadFile()` method with proper error handling
  - Added download progress indicator in AppBar
  - Updated download buttons to show progress
  - Added success/error SnackBar notifications

## Technical Details

### File Download Flow
1. User taps download button in media viewer
2. System checks current platform and gets appropriate directory
3. Creates "SamaNet" subfolder if it doesn't exist
4. Checks if file already exists and adds timestamp if needed
5. Downloads file using Dio with progress callback
6. Updates UI with download progress
7. Shows success message with file path or error message

### File Sending Protection
1. User taps attachment button and selects file
2. System checks `_isUploadingFile` flag
3. If already uploading, shows debug message and returns early
4. Sets `_isUploadingFile = true`
5. Performs upload and send
6. Resets flag in finally block with mounted check

### Download Paths by Platform
- **Android**: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/[package]/files/SamaNet/`
- **iOS**: `[Documents Directory]/SamaNet/`
- **Other**: `[Downloads Directory]/SamaNet/`

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
path_provider: ^2.1.1
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. **Sending Files**: Simply tap the attachment button and select your file - it will only send once now
2. **Downloading Files**: 
   - Tap on any received file attachment to open the media viewer
   - Tap the download button in the top-right corner
   - Watch the progress indicator
   - File will be saved in "SamaNet" folder in your downloads/documents

### For Developers
- The `_isUploadingFile` flag prevents concurrent uploads
- Download progress can be monitored via the callback
- All file operations include proper error handling
- Platform-specific paths are handled automatically

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test file sending with quick repeated taps
2. Test downloading various file types (images, videos, documents)
3. Test downloading the same file multiple times (should add timestamp)
4. Test on different platforms (Android, iOS)
5. Test with poor network conditions
6. Test with various file sizes

## Future Enhancements
- Audio player implementation in media viewer
- Resume failed downloads
- Download manager with queue
- Share downloaded files to other apps
- Delete downloaded files option
- Storage usage statistics

## Notes
- Maximum file size limit remains at 10MB
- Supported file types are defined in `FileService.isFileTypeSupported()`
- Downloads are saved in app-specific directories for better organization
- File paths are URL-encoded to handle special characters
