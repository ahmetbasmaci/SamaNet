## Architecture

### NotificationService Features:
```dart
- initialize()                          // Initialize notifications
- requestPermissions()                  // Request iOS permissions
- showDownloadCompleteNotification()    // Show completion notification
- showDownloadProgressNotification()    // (Optional) Show progress
- openFile()                           // Open file with system app
```

### Notification Flow:
1. User downloads a file in MediaViewer
2. Download completes successfully
3. NotificationService creates notification with file path as payload
4. User sees notification: "تم تحميل الملف" (File downloaded)
5. User taps notification
6. System calls `_onNotificationTapped()` callback
7. File opens with appropriate system app

### File Opening Flow:
1. Notification tapped OR SnackBar "Open" button tapped
2. `openFile(filePath)` called
3. Uses `OpenFilex` package to find appropriate app
4. Opens file with system default app for that file type

## Android Configuration

### Permissions Added:
```xml
<!-- Notification permissions for Android 13+ -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
```

### Notification Receivers:
```xml
<receiver android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationReceiver"/>
<receiver android:name="com.dexterous.flutterlocalnotifications.ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED"/>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED"/>
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

### File Opening Queries:
```xml
<queries>
    <!-- Query for opening files with external apps -->
    <intent>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
        <data android:mimeType="*/*" />
    </intent>
</queries>
```

## iOS Configuration (Info.plist)
No additional configuration needed! The package handles it automatically.

## Usage Example

### Basic Usage:
```dart
// Download completes
final result = await _fileService.downloadFile(filePath);

// Show notification
await _notificationService.showDownloadCompleteNotification(
  fileName: 'document.pdf',
  filePath: result.data!,
);

// User taps notification → file opens automatically
```

### Manual File Opening:
```dart
// Open file programmatically
await _notificationService.openFile('/path/to/file.pdf');
```

## Notification Channels

### Download Complete Channel:
- **ID**: `download_channel`
- **Name**: "File Downloads"
- **Importance**: High
- **Shows**: Badge, alert, sound

### Download Progress Channel (Optional):
- **ID**: `download_progress_channel`
- **Name**: "Download Progress"
- **Importance**: Low
- **Shows**: Progress bar, no sound

## Supported File Types

The app can open any file type that has an associated app installed:
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, BMP
- **Videos**: MP4, AVI, MOV, WMV, FLV, WEBM
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, FLAC, M4A
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR, GZ

## Error Handling

### Notification Errors:
- Automatically initializes if not initialized
- Requests permissions on iOS
- Gracefully handles permission denials

### File Opening Errors:
- Catches and logs errors
- Shows appropriate error messages
- Handles missing apps for file types

## User Experience Flow

1. **User downloads file** → Progress shown in MediaViewer
2. **Download completes** → 3 things happen:
   - ✅ SnackBar shows with "Open" button
   - ✅ Local notification appears
   - ✅ File saved to SamaNet folder
3. **User taps notification** → File opens in appropriate app
4. **Alternative**: User taps "Open" in SnackBar → Same result

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Download a PDF → Tap notification → Opens in PDF reader
- [ ] Download an image → Tap notification → Opens in gallery
- [ ] Download a video → Tap notification → Opens in video player
- [ ] Download a document → Tap notification → Opens in appropriate app
- [ ] Test on Android 13+ (notification permissions)
- [ ] Test on iOS (notification permissions)
- [ ] Test SnackBar "Open" button
- [ ] Test with no appropriate app installed (should show error)
- [ ] Test notification when app is in background
- [ ] Test notification when app is closed

## Technical Notes

### Notification Payload:
- Contains the full file path
- Used to open file when notification is tapped
- Persists until notification is dismissed

### File Path Format:
- **Android**: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/[package]/files/SamaNet/[filename]`
- **iOS**: `[Documents]/SamaNet/[filename]`

### Permission Handling:
- **Android**: Automatic for notifications (except Android 13+)
- **iOS**: Requests on first use
- Returns `false` if denied, but doesn't block functionality

## Future Enhancements

### Planned:
- [ ] Download progress notifications (currently implemented but not used)
- [ ] Notification actions (Share, Delete)
- [ ] Notification grouping for multiple downloads
- [ ] Custom notification sound
- [ ] Notification history

### Possible:
- [ ] Scheduled notifications for pending downloads
- [ ] Download queue with notifications
- [ ] Notification settings page
- [ ] Dark/Light mode notification icons

## Troubleshooting

### Notification not showing:
1. Check permissions in device settings
2. Verify notification service is initialized
3. Check Android notification channels aren't blocked

### File not opening:
1. Verify file exists at path
2. Check if appropriate app is installed
3. Verify file permissions
4. Check Android file provider configuration

### iOS specific issues:
1. Run on physical device (notifications may not work in simulator)
2. Check notification permissions in Settings
3. Verify app has proper entitlements
