# Video Player Fix - Quick Checklist ‚úÖ

## The Problem
‚ùå **Error 1:** `Cleartext HTTP traffic to 10.0.2.2 not permitted`
- ExoPlayer couldn't stream videos from the emulator's localhost

‚ùå **Error 2:** `RenderFlex overflowed by 215 pixels`
- Video viewer UI had layout overflow issue

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Network Security Configuration (CRITICAL)
**File:** `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
- Added `10.0.2.2` (Android emulator)
- Added `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
- Kept `192.168.1.99` (real device)

### 2. ‚úÖ Backend HTTP Range Support
**File:** `SamaNetMessaegingAppApi/Controllers/FilesController.cs`
- Added HTTP 206 Partial Content support
- Videos now stream in chunks instead of loading entirely
- Better for ExoPlayer compatibility

### 3. ‚úÖ Flutter Error Handling & UI Fix
**File:** `lib/presentation/widgets/media_viewer.dart`
- Better error messages
- Download fallback option
- Detailed logging for debugging
- **Fixed overflow:** Wrapped video viewer in `SingleChildScrollView`
- Added padding to video progress indicator

## Steps to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Backend API ‚öôÔ∏è
```powershell
cd d:\projects\flutter_projects\SamaNet\SamaNetMessaegingAppApi\SamaNetMessaegingAppApi
dotnet run
```
‚úÖ API should be running on `http://localhost:7073`

### Step 2: Rebuild Flutter App üì±
```powershell
cd d:\projects\flutter_projects\SamaNet\sama_net_messaging_app_mobile
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
‚úÖ **MUST do `flutter clean`** - network config changes require full rebuild!

### Step 3: Test Video ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
1. ‚úÖ Send a video (camera or gallery)
2. ‚úÖ Wait for upload
3. ‚úÖ Tap video to open
4. ‚úÖ Video should play!

## If Still Not Working

### Quick Fix: Uninstall & Reinstall
```powershell
# Uninstall from emulator
adb uninstall com.example.sama_net_messaging_app_mobile

# Rebuild
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Check These:
- [ ] API is running on port 7073
- [ ] Using emulator (not real device)
- [ ] `network_security_config.xml` has `10.0.2.2`
- [ ] Did `flutter clean` before rebuilding
- [ ] Video is in MP4 format

## Quick Test Commands

**Check if API is running:**
```powershell
curl http://10.0.2.2:7073/api/health
```

**Check video endpoint:**
```powershell
# Replace with actual file path
curl -I "http://10.0.2.2:7073/api/files/stream?filePath=uploads/video/test.mp4"
```

## Testing on Real Device

If testing on a **real Android device** (not emulator):
1. Make sure device is on same WiFi as your PC
2. Use `http://192.168.1.99:7073` (your PC's IP)
3. Network config already includes this IP ‚úÖ

## Success Indicators ‚úÖ

When everything works, you should see:
```
I/flutter: [MediaViewer] Initializing video player with URL: http://10.0.2.2:7073/api/files/stream?filePath=...
I/flutter: [MediaViewer] Video player initialized successfully
```

**No more:**
- ‚ùå `Cleartext HTTP traffic not permitted`
- ‚ùå `ExoPlaybackException: Source error`
