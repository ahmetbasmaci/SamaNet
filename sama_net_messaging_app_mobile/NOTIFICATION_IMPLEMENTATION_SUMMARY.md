## What Was Added

### ✅ Local Notifications

- Works for all file types (PDF, images, videos, documents, etc.)

### ✅ Cross-Platform

## Modified Files

1. **`pubspec.yaml`** - Added packages

## How It Works

```
User downloads file
       ↓
Download completes successfully
       ↓
NotificationService.showDownloadCompleteNotification()
       ↓
User sees notification: "تم تحميل document.pdf بنجاح. اضغط للفتح"
       ↓
User taps notification
       ↓
File opens in appropriate app (PDF reader, gallery, etc.)
```

## Testing

### Quick Test:
1. Run app: `flutter run`
2. Go to conversation page
3. Download any file attachment
4. Wait for notification
5. Tap notification
6. File should open in system app

### File Types to Test:
- ✅ PDF documents

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Get dependencies

flutter pub get

# 2. Run app
flutter run

# That's it! Notifications are automatically initialized
```

## Android Permissions

## iOS Permissions

## User Experience

### Before:
- Download file
- No notification
- User doesn't know where file is saved
- Can't easily open file

### After:
- Download file ✅
- Notification appears immediately ✅
- Shows file name and location ✅
- Tap notification → Opens file ✅
- Alternative: Tap SnackBar "Open" button ✅

## Code Changes Summary

### NotificationService:
```dart
// Show notification after download
await _notificationService.showDownloadCompleteNotification(
  fileName: 'document.pdf',
  filePath: '/path/to/document.pdf',
);
```

### MediaViewer:
```dart
// Added notification + open button in SnackBar
if (result.isSuccess) {
  await _notificationService.showDownloadCompleteNotification(...);
  ScaffoldMessenger.show(
    SnackBar(
      content: Text('تم تحميل الملف بنجاح'),
      action: SnackBarAction(
        label: 'فتح',
        onPressed: () => _notificationService.openFile(filePath),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Features

### Notification Features:
- ✅ Automatic initialization
- ✅ Permission handling

- ✅ High priority notification
- ✅ Sound and vibration

### File Opening Features:
- ✅ Opens in system default app

## What Happens When User Taps Notification

1. Notification callback triggered
2. Gets file path from notification payload
3. Calls `openFile(filePath)`
4. System finds appropriate app for file type
5. Opens file in that app
6. User views/edits file
7. Done!

## Error Handling

### Notification Errors:
- Permission denied → Service continues without notifications
- Not initialized → Auto-initializes when needed

### File Opening Errors:
- File not found → Shows error message
- No app available → System shows "Can't open file" dialog
- Permission issue → Logs error and shows message

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
2. ✅ Run app: `flutter run`
3. ✅ Test download functionality
4. ✅ Verify notifications appear
5. ✅ Test file opening
